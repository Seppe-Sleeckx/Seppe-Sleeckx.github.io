      <h1>Environments 1 assignment</h1>
      <p>
        Environments 1 wasn't exactly my favourite course, to be quite frank. I've never been very artistic or good 
        at making anything look good, whether in 2D or 3D, so taking this course as an elective felt like probably 
        one of the dumbest mistakes I could have made going into my second year at DAE. Every assignment always felt 
        like a struggle, and in the beginning, I had no clue what I was supposed to be doing. However, I do think now, 
        looking back, that even though I'm still not nearly as good at making visually appealing 3D assets as some of 
        the artists who took this course, I feel like I've learned a lot about the process that artists have to go through 
        to create game-ready assets. More importantly, it has made me more aware of how every aspect of a game is made, 
        not just the programming part. It also makes it easier for me to talk with artists about the vision for a game 
        to make sure we're all on the same wavelength.
