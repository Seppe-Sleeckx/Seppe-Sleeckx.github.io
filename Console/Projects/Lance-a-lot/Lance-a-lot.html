      <h1>Lance-a-lot</h1>
      <p>
        Lance-a-lot was a school project made for the course Game projects 
        that I worked on in group during the second semester of my second year at DAE. Looking back at it it helped me realize how quickly
        a project/codebase can get messy if you don't set up solid rules and guidelines about folder structures/naming conventions etc. 
        I am however really happy with the end result for the relatively short time we worked on the project and had an absolute blast 
        working together with all of my talented group members.
