      <h1>Game engine Fundamentals</h1>
      <p>
        For the course Game Engine Fundamentals we had to make two projects, one in unity and one in unreal to help us learn the basics of each engine. This was the first time I got to 
        actually use a professional engine with an editor and compared to the "engines" we had used before, these made creating and iterating on a game so much quicker and easier 
        (who would've thought, right?). They allowed me to add more features faster and also to make something that's actually fun to play. On top of that, I got to experiment with 
        more advanced features the engines we used previously didn't have like physics and inverse kinematics.
