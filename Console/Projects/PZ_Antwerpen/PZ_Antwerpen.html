      <h1>PZ Antwerp</h1>
      <p>
        At the end of my secondary school career I had to do a ~4 week internship which i did at the police department of my home town 
        of Antwerp. This was mainly possible because the Antwerp police department has quite a large IT department that develops it's
        own in house application called "FOCUS" amongst other tasks like developing small applications using microsoft powerapps to 
        quickly fulfill the needs of the police force short-term. I worked on the latter developing a small application in collaboration 
        with my mentor at the company. Looking back at it it was a fun challenge and something completely different from what I had done 
        before but Microsoft Powerapps does have it's limitations that make it less interesting for developing things outside the microsoft 
        ecosystem or just about any larger scale applications amongst others. So although interesting it isn't something I can see myself 
        working with again in the near-future.
