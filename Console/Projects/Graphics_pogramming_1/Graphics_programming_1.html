      <h1>Graphics programming 1</h1>
      <p>
        Graphics programming 1 was probably one of the most interesting courses I've had during my two years at DAE. In only a single semester we were thaught the basics of the rendering pipeline
        and we got to write our own (basic) ray tracer and rasterizer. Although obviously not as performant or complex as some existing render engines out there it was meant to teach us
        the basics in order for us to really understand how we go from 0's and 1's to generating frames that can be used in games or other 3D applications.
